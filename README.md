# AssessmentSubmission
-Compilation

The project needs no compilation i used plain CSS, JS and HTML, all there is to do is esure  files on your local directory
files include:
vaimoAssessment.html<br />
main.css<br />
mobile.css<br />
images(folder)<br />

-OverView


I used a Fetch API to get code from the designated address convert it into HTML all in 1 script tag, loading it into an empty div.   



-Stack

I chose to go the simple route as Iâ€™m not really familiar with JS frameworks, and usually work mostly using plain CSS, JS and HTML also I firmly believe that, though it might be a little bit of heavy lifting here and there, a lot can be achieved with some vanilla JS. If I were to do things different id begin with adding CSS pre-processors thus freeing the CSS clutter and repetition and make changes to CSS much fater when editing the design. Secondly use a framework to do some of the heavy lifting and take advantage of libraries such as moment JS or Day JS for a little added functionality. Also structure my elements more efficiently, using proper naming conventions and avoid repeating code.
